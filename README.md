# Cause Effect

Patterns are integral to software engineering and represent potentially
reusable components in program logic. However, patterns aren't used only
for program logic, they are exist in other domains such as DevOps, user
support, and the user interface.

A common user interface pattern is to summarize data in one section of a page
that consists of some type of list (like text, images, or icons) that describes
or categorizes a set of data. When a list item is clicked, the detailed data
behind it is displayed in an adjacent pane on the page.

For example, on a real estate site clicking an address in a list of properties
for sale displays the details about the property in another part of the
page.

The project consists of a page where the admin can add a new user and edit it.
